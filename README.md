   - Endpoint to upload and update crime data from JSON files.
   - Validate the data format before ingestion.

2. **Data Querying**
   - Endpoint to query crimes by date range.
   - Endpoint to query crimes by type (e.g., homicide, robbery).
   - Endpoint to query crimes by neighborhood.
   - Endpoint to query crimes by division.

3. **Data Aggregation**
   - Endpoint to get the number of crimes per year.
   - Endpoint to get the number of crimes per neighborhood.
   - Endpoint to get the number of crimes per type.

4. **Geospatial Queries**
   - Endpoint to find crimes within a certain radius of a given location (latitude and longitude).

5. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - User registration and login.
   - JWT-based authentication.
   - Role-based access control to restrict access to certain endpoints.

6. **Documentation**
